# Clinical Text Summarization

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to summarize clinical text from medical documents. It preprocesses text using spaCy, chunks it for summarization, and generates concise summaries using a transformer-based model (T5). The summarization quality is evaluated using ROUGE scores.
