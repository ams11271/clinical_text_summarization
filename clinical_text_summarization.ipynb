See Section 2.2 for subcutaneous administration in persons at \\nrisk of hemorrhage. \\n\\n2.1 Preparation for Administration  \\n\\nShake well before use. With thorough agitation, ENGERIX-B is a homogeneous, turbid white \\nsuspension. Do not administer if it appears otherwise. Parenteral drug products should be \\ninspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever \\nsolution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be \\nadministered. \\n\\nFor the prefilled syringes, attach a sterile needle and administer intramuscularly. \\n\\nFor the vials, use a sterile needle and sterile syringe to withdraw the vaccine dose and administer \\nintramuscularly. Changing needles between drawing vaccine from a vial and injecting it into a \\nrecipient is not necessary unless the needle has been damaged or contaminated. Use a separate \\nsterile needle and syringe for each individual. \\n\\n2.2 Administration  \\n\\nENGERIX-B should be administered by intramuscular injection. The preferred administration \\nsite is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh for infants younger than 1 year and the deltoid muscle \\nin older children (whose deltoid is large enough for an intramuscular injection) and adults. \\nENGERIX-B should not be administered in the gluteal region; such injections may result in \\nsuboptimal response. \\n\\nENGERIX-B may be administered subcutaneously to persons at risk of hemorrhage (e.g., \\nhemophiliacs). However, hepatitis B vaccines administered subcutaneously are known to result \\nin a lower antibody response. Additionally, when other aluminum-adsorbed vaccines have been \\nadministered subcutaneously, an increased incidence of local reactions including subcutaneous \\nnodules has been observed. Therefore, subcutaneous administration should be used only in \\npersons who are at risk of hemorrhage with intramuscular injections. \\n\\nDo not administer this product intravenously or intradermally. \\n\\n2.3 Recommended Dose and Schedule  \\n\\nPersons from Birth through 19 Years \\n\\nPrimary immunization for infants (born of hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]-negative or \\nHBsAg-positive mothers), children (birth through 10 years), and adolescents (aged 11 through 19 \\nyears) consists of a series of 3 doses (0.5 mL each) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. \\n\\nPersons Aged 20 Years and Older \\n\\nPrimary immunization for persons aged 20 years and older consists of a series of 3 doses (1 mL \\neach) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. \\n\\n\\n\\n3 \\n\\nAdults on Hemodialysis \\n\\nPrimary immunization consists of a series of 4 doses (2-mL each) given as a single 2-mL dose or \\ntwo 1-mL doses on a 0-, 1-, 2-, and 6-month schedule. In hemodialysis patients, antibody \\nresponse is lower than in healthy persons and protection may persist only as long as antibody \\nlevels remain above 10 mIU/mL. Therefore, the need for booster doses should be assessed by \\nannual antibody testing. A 2-mL booster dose (as a single 2-mL dose or two 1-mL doses) should \\nbe given when antibody levels decline below 10 mIU/mL.1 [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] \\n\\nTable 1.

For some of \\nthese alternate schedules, an additional dose at 12 months is recommended for prolonged \\nmaintenance of protective titers. \\n\\n\\n\\n4 \\n\\nTable 2.

Studies have \\ndemonstrated a substantial increase in antibody titers after booster vaccination with \\nENGERIX-B. See Section 2.3 for information on booster vaccination for adults on hemodialysis. \\n\\n2.6 Known or Presumed Exposure to Hepatitis B Virus  \\n\\nPersons with known or presumed exposure to the hepatitis B virus (e.g., neonates born of \\ninfected mothers, persons who experienced percutaneous or permucosal exposure to the virus) \\nshould be given hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) in addition to ENGERIX-B in accordance \\nwith Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations and with the package \\ninsert for HBIG. ENGERIX-B can be given on either dosing schedule (0, 1, and 6 months or 0, \\n1, 2, and 12 months). \\n\\n3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS  \\n\\nENGERIX-B is a sterile suspension available in the following presentations: \\n• 0.5-mL (10 mcg) prefilled TIP-LOK syringes \\n• 1-mL (20 mcg) single-dose vials and prefilled TIP-LOK syringes \\n\\n[See Description (11), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16).] \\n\\n\\n\\n5 \\n\\n4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  \\n\\nSevere allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any hepatitis B-containing \\nvaccine, or to any component of ENGERIX-B, including yeast, is a contraindication to \\nadministration of ENGERIX-B [see Description (11)]. \\n\\n5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  \\n\\n5.1 Syncope  \\n\\nSyncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including \\nENGERIX-B. Syncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual \\ndisturbance, paresthesia, and tonic-clonic limb movements. Procedures should be in place to \\navoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope. \\n\\n5.2 Infants Weighing Less than 2,000 g at Birth  \\n\\nHepatitis B vaccine should be deferred for infants with a birth weight <2,000 g if the mother is \\ndocumented to be HBsAg negative at the time of the infant’s birth. Vaccination can commence at \\nchronological age 1 month or hospital discharge. Infants born weighing <2,000 g to HBsAg-\\npositive mothers should receive vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours after birth. Infants born \\nweighing <2,000 g to mothers of unknown HBsAg status should receive vaccine and HBIG \\nwithin 12 hours after birth if the mother’s HBsAg status cannot be determined within the first 12 \\nhours of life. The birth dose in infants born weighing <2,000 g should not be counted as the first \\ndose in the vaccine series and it should be followed with a full 3-dose standard regimen (total of \\n4 doses).2 [See Dosage and Administration (2).] \\n\\n5.3 Apnea in Premature Infants  \\n\\nApnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. \\nDecisions about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including ENGERIX-B, to infants \\nborn prematurely should be based on consideration of the infant’s medical status, and the \\npotential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. For ENGERIX-B, this assessment should \\ninclude consideration of the mother’s hepatitis B antigen status and the high probability of \\nmaternal transmission of hepatitis B virus to infants born of mothers who are HBsAg positive if \\nvaccination is delayed. \\n\\n5.4 Preventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions  \\n\\nPrior to immunization, the healthcare provider should review the immunization history for \\npossible vaccine sensitivity and previous vaccination-related adverse reactions to allow an \\nassessment of benefits and risks. Epinephrine and other appropriate agents used for the control of \\nimmediate allergic reactions must be immediately available should an acute anaphylactic \\nreaction occur. [See Contraindications (4).] \\n\\n\\n\\n6 \\n\\n5.5 Moderate or Severe Acute Illness  \\n\\nTo avoid diagnostic confusion between manifestations of an acute illness and possible vaccine \\nadverse effects, vaccination with ENGERIX-B should be postponed in persons with moderate or \\nsevere acute febrile illness unless they are at immediate risk of hepatitis B infection (e.g., infants \\nborn of HBsAg-positive mothers). \\n\\n5.6 Altered Immunocompetence  \\n\\nImmunocompromised persons may have a diminished immune response to ENGERIX-B, \\nincluding individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy. \\n\\n5.7 Multiple Sclerosis  \\n\\nResults from 2 clinical studies indicate that there is no association between hepatitis B \\nvaccination and the development of multiple sclerosis,3 and that vaccination with hepatitis B \\nvaccine does not appear to increase the short-term risk of relapse in multiple sclerosis.4 \\n\\n5.8 Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness  \\n\\nHepatitis B has a long incubation period. ENGERIX-B may not prevent hepatitis B infection in \\nindividuals who had an unrecognized hepatitis B infection at the time of vaccine administration. \\nAdditionally, it may not prevent infection in individuals who do not achieve protective antibody \\ntiters. \\n\\n6 ADVERSE REACTIONS  \\n\\n6.1 Clinical Trials Experience  \\n\\nBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates \\nobserved in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical \\ntrials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. \\n\\nThe most common solicited adverse reactions were injection site soreness (22%) and fatigue \\n(14%). \\n\\nIn 36 clinical studies, a total of 13,495 doses of ENGERIX-B were administered to 5,071 healthy \\nadults and children who were initially seronegative for hepatitis B markers, and healthy \\nneonates. All subjects were monitored for 4 days post-administration. Frequency of adverse \\nreactions tended to decrease with successive doses of ENGERIX-B. \\n\\nUsing a symptom checklist, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site \\nsoreness (22%) and fatigue (14%). Other reactions are listed below. Parent or guardian \\ncompleted forms for children and neonates. Neonatal checklist did not include headache, fatigue, \\nor dizziness. \\n\\nIncidence 1% to 10% of Injections \\n\\nNervous System Disorders: Dizziness, headache. \\n\\n\\n\\n7 \\n\\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Fever (>37.5°C), injection site erythema, \\ninjection site induration, injection site swelling. \\n\\nIncidence <1% of Injections \\n\\nInfections and Infestations: Upper respiratory tract illnesses. \\n\\nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Lymphadenopathy. \\n\\nMetabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Anorexia. \\n\\nPsychiatric Disorders: Agitation, insomnia. \\n\\nNervous System Disorders: Somnolence, tingling. \\n\\nVascular Disorders: Flushing, hypotension. \\n\\nGastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain/cramps, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting. \\n\\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Erythema, petechiae, pruritus, rash, sweating, urticaria. \\n\\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, pain/stiffness \\nin arm, shoulder, or neck. \\n\\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chills, influenza-like symptoms, \\ninjection site ecchymosis, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, irritability, malaise, \\nweakness. \\n\\nIn a clinical trial, 416 adults with type 2 diabetes and 258 control subjects without type 2 \\ndiabetes who were seronegative for hepatitis B markers received at least 1 dose of ENGERIX-B. \\nSubjects were monitored for solicited adverse reactions for 4 days following each vaccination. \\nThe most frequently reported solicited adverse reactions in the entire study population were \\ninjection site pain (reported in 39% of diabetic subjects and 45% of control subjects) and fatigue \\n(reported in 29% of diabetic subjects and 27% of control subjects). Serious adverse events were \\nmonitored through 30 days following the last vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs) \\noccurred in 3.8% of diabetic subjects and 1.6% of controls. No SAEs were deemed related to \\nENGERIX-B. \\n\\n6.2 Postmarketing Experience  \\n\\nThe following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ENGERIX-B. \\nBecause these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not \\nalways possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the \\nvaccine. \\n\\nInfections and Infestations \\n\\nHerpes zoster, meningitis. \\n\\n\\n\\n8 \\n\\nBlood and Lymphatic System Disorders \\n\\nThrombocytopenia. \\n\\nImmune System Disorders \\n\\nAllergic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis. An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome \\n(serum sickness-like) of delayed onset has been reported days to weeks after vaccination, \\nincluding: arthralgia/arthritis (usually transient), fever, and dermatologic reactions such as \\nurticaria, erythema multiforme, ecchymoses, and erythema nodosum. \\n\\nNervous System Disorders \\n\\nEncephalitis; encephalopathy; migraine; multiple sclerosis; neuritis; neuropathy including \\nhypoesthesia, paresthesia, Guillain-Barré syndrome and Bell’s palsy; optic neuritis; paralysis; \\nparesis; seizures; syncope; transverse myelitis. \\n\\nEye Disorders \\n\\nConjunctivitis, keratitis, visual disturbances. \\n\\nEar and Labyrinth Disorders \\n\\nEarache, tinnitus, vertigo. \\n\\nCardiac Disorders \\n\\nPalpitations, tachycardia. \\n\\nVascular Disorders \\n\\nVasculitis. \\n\\nRespiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders \\n\\nApnea, bronchospasm including asthma-like symptoms. \\n\\nGastrointestinal Disorders \\n\\nDyspepsia. \\n\\nSkin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders \\n\\nAlopecia, angioedema, eczema, erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, \\nerythema nodosum, lichen planus, purpura. \\n\\nMusculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders \\n\\nArthritis, muscular weakness. \\n\\nGeneral Disorders and Administration Site Conditions \\n\\nInjection site reaction. \\n\\n\\n\\n9 \\n\\nInvestigations \\n\\nAbnormal liver function tests. \\n\\n7 DRUG INTERACTIONS  \\n\\n7.1 Concomitant Administration with Vaccines and Immune Globulin  \\n\\nENGERIX-B may be administered concomitantly with immune globulin. \\n\\nWhen concomitant administration of other vaccines or immune globulin is required, they should \\nbe given with different syringes and at different injection sites. Do not mix ENGERIX-B with \\nany other vaccine or product in the same syringe or vial. \\n\\n7.2 Interference with Laboratory Tests  \\n\\nHBsAg derived from hepatitis B vaccines has been transiently detected in blood samples \\nfollowing vaccination. Serum HBsAg detection may not have diagnostic value within 28 days \\nafter receipt of a hepatitis B vaccine, including ENGERIX-B. \\n\\n8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS  \\n\\n8.1 Pregnancy  \\n\\nRisk Summary \\n\\nAll pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general \\npopulation, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically \\nrecognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. \\n\\nThere are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ENGERIX-B in pregnant women in the \\nU.S. Available data do not suggest an increased risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in \\nwomen who received ENGERIX-B during pregnancy (see Data). \\n\\nThere are no animal studies with ENGERIX-B to inform use during pregnancy. A developmental \\ntoxicity study was performed in female rats administered a vaccine with the same hepatitis B \\nsurface antigen component and quantity as ENGERIX-B prior to mating and during gestation \\n(0.2 mL at each occasion). This study revealed no adverse effects on fetal or pre-weaning \\ndevelopment (see Data). \\n\\nData \\n\\nHuman Data: In an evaluation of pre- and post-licensure clinical trials of ENGERIX-B, 58 \\npregnant women were inadvertently administered ENGERIX-B following their last menstrual \\nperiod. After excluding elective terminations (n = 6), those with an unknown outcome (n = 3), \\nthose with exposure in the third trimester (n = 1), and those with an unknown exposure timing \\n(n = 22), there were 26 pregnancies with known outcomes with exposure in the first or second \\ntrimester. Miscarriage was reported in 11.5% of pregnancies with exposure prior to 20 weeks of \\ngestation (3/26) and major birth defects were reported in 0% (0/23) of live births born to women \\n\\n\\n\\n10 \\n\\nwith exposure during the first or second trimester. The rates of miscarriage and major birth \\ndefects were consistent with estimated background rates. \\n\\nNo pregnancy registry for ENGERIX-B was conducted. TWINRIX [Hepatitis A & Hepatitis B \\n(Recombinant) Vaccine] is a bivalent vaccine containing the same hepatitis B surface antigen \\ncomponent and quantity as used in ENGERIX-B. Therefore, clinical data accrued with \\nTWINRIX are relevant to ENGERIX-B. A pregnancy exposure registry was maintained for \\nTWINRIX from 2001 to 2015. The registry prospectively enrolled 245 women who received a \\ndose of TWINRIX during pregnancy or within 28 days prior to conception. After excluding \\ninduced abortions (n = 6, including one of a fetus with congenital anomalies), those lost to \\nfollow-up (n = 142), those with exposure in the third trimester (n = 1), and those with an \\nunknown exposure timing (n = 9), there were 87 pregnancies with known outcomes with \\nexposure within 28 days prior to conception, or in the first or second trimesters. Miscarriage was \\nreported for 9.6% of pregnancies with exposure to TWINRIX prior to 20 weeks gestation (8/83). \\nMajor birth defects were reported for 3.8% of live born infants whose mothers were exposed \\nwithin 28 days prior to conception or during the first or second trimester (3/80). The rates of \\nmiscarriage and major birth defects were consistent with estimated background rates. \\n\\nAnimal Data: In a developmental toxicity study, female rats were administered TWINRIX, \\nwhich contains the same hepatitis B surface antigen component and quantity as ENGERIX-B, by \\nintramuscular injection on Day 30 prior to mating and on gestation Days 6, 8, 11, and 15. The \\ntotal dose was 0.2 mL (divided) at each occasion (a single human dose is 1 mL). No adverse \\neffects on pre-weaning development up to post-natal Day 25 were observed. There were no fetal \\nmalformations or variations. \\n\\n8.2 Lactation  \\n\\nRisk Summary \\n\\nThere is no information regarding the presence of ENGERIX-B in human milk, the effects on the \\nbreastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of \\nbreastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for ENGERIX-B and \\nany potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ENGERIX-B or from the underlying \\nmaternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility \\nto disease prevented by the vaccine. \\n\\n8.4 Pediatric Use  \\n\\nSafety and effectiveness of ENGERIX-B have been established in all pediatric age-groups. \\nMaternally transferred antibodies do not interfere with the active immune response to the \\nvaccine. [See Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.3, 14.4).] \\n\\nThe timing of the first dose in infants weighing less than 2,000 g at birth depends on the HBsAg \\nstatus of the mother. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2).] \\n\\n\\n\\n11 \\n\\n8.5 Geriatric Use  \\n\\nClinical studies of ENGERIX-B used for licensure did not include sufficient numbers of subjects \\naged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. \\nHowever, in later studies it has been shown that a diminished antibody response and \\nseroprotective levels can be expected in persons older than 60 years.5 [See Clinical Studies \\n(14.2).] \\n\\n11 DESCRIPTION  \\n\\nENGERIX-B [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)] is a sterile suspension of noninfectious \\nHBsAg for intramuscular administration. It contains purified surface antigen of the virus \\nobtained by culturing genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, which carry the \\nsurface antigen gene of the hepatitis B virus. The HBsAg expressed in the cells is purified by \\nseveral physicochemical steps and formulated as a suspension of the antigen adsorbed on \\naluminum hydroxide. The procedures used to manufacture ENGERIX-B result in a product that \\ncontains no more than 5% yeast protein. \\n\\nEach 0.5-mL pediatric/adolescent dose contains 10 mcg of HBsAg adsorbed on 0.25 mg \\naluminum as aluminum hydroxide. \\n\\nEach 1-mL adult dose contains 20 mcg of HBsAg adsorbed on 0.5 mg aluminum as aluminum \\nhydroxide. \\n\\nENGERIX-B contains the following excipients: Sodium chloride (8 mg/mL) and phosphate \\nbuffers (disodium phosphate dihydrate, 0.9 mg/mL; sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, \\n0.7 mg/mL). \\n\\nENGERIX-B is available in vials (adult dose only) and prefilled syringes. The tip cap and rubber \\nplunger stopper of the prefilled syringe are not made with natural rubber latex. The vial stoppers \\nare not made with natural rubber latex. \\n\\nENGERIX-B is formulated without preservatives. \\n\\n12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  \\n\\n12.1 Mechanism of Action  \\n\\nInfection with hepatitis B virus can have serious consequences including acute massive hepatic \\nnecrosis and chronic active hepatitis. Chronically infected persons are at increased risk for \\ncirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. \\n\\nAntibody concentrations ≥10 mIU/mL against HBsAg are recognized as conferring protection \\nagainst hepatitis B virus infection.1 Seroconversion is defined as antibody titers ≥1 mIU/mL. \\n\\n\\n\\n12 \\n\\n13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  \\n\\n13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility  \\n\\nENGERIX-B has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment \\nof male fertility in animals. Vaccination of female rats with TWINRIX, which contains the same \\nHBsAg component and quantity as ENGERIX-B, had no effect on fertility. [See Use in Specific \\nPopulations (8.1).] \\n\\n14 CLINICAL STUDIES  \\n\\n14.1 Efficacy in Neonates  \\n\\nProtective efficacy with ENGERIX-B has been demonstrated in a clinical trial in neonates at \\nhigh risk of hepatitis B infection.6,7 Fifty-eight neonates born of mothers who were both HBsAg-\\npositive and hepatitis B “e” antigen (HBeAg)-positive were given ENGERIX-B \\n(10 mcg/0.5 mL) at 0, 1, and 2 months, without concomitant hepatitis B immune globulin \\n(HBIG). Two infants became chronic carriers in the 12-month follow-up period after initial \\ninoculation. Assuming an expected carrier rate of 70%, the protective efficacy rate against the \\nchronic carrier state during the first 12 months of life was 95%. \\n\\n14.2 Efficacy and Immunogenicity in Specific Populations  \\n\\nHomosexual Men \\n\\nENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) given at 0, 1, and 6 months was evaluated in homosexual men \\naged 16 to 59 years. Four of 244 subjects became infected with hepatitis B during the period \\nprior to completion of the 3-dose immunization schedule. No additional subjects became infected \\nduring the 18-month follow-up period after completion of the immunization course. \\n\\nAdults with Chronic Hepatitis C \\n\\nIn a clinical trial of 67 adults aged 25 to 67 years with chronic hepatitis C, ENGERIX-B \\n(20 mcg/1 mL) was given at 0, 1, and 6 months. Of the subjects assessed at Month 7 (n = 31), \\n100% responded with seroprotective titers. The geometric mean antibody titer (GMT) was \\n1,260 mIU/mL (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 709, 2,237). \\n\\nAdults on Hemodialysis \\n\\nHemodialysis patients given hepatitis B vaccines respond with lower titers, which remain at \\nprotective levels for shorter durations than in normal subjects. In a clinical trial of 56 adults who \\nhad been on hemodialysis for a mean period of 56 months, ENGERIX-B (40 mcg/2 mL given as \\ntwo 1-mL doses) was given at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. Two months after the fourth dose, 67% \\n(29/43) of patients had seroprotective antibody levels (≥10 mIU/mL) and the GMT among \\nseroconverters was 93 mIU/mL. \\n\\n\\n\\n13 \\n\\nAdults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \\n\\nIn a descriptive study, 674 adult subjects with type 2 diabetes (diagnosed within the preceding 5 \\nyears) or without type 2 diabetes were enrolled and stratified by age and body mass index (BMI). \\nThe per-protocol immunogenicity cohort included 378 diabetic subjects and 189 matched control \\nsubjects who received ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) at 0, 1, and 6 months. Among these subjects, \\nthe mean age was 54 years (range: 20 to 82 years); mean BMI was 32 kg/m2 (range: 17 to 64 \\nkg/m2); 51% were male; 88% were white, 3% were American Indian or Alaskan Native, 3% \\nwere black, 2% were Asian, 4% were other racial groups; 2% were Hispanic or Latino. \\n\\nThe overall seroprotection rates (1 month after the third dose) were 75% (95% CI: 71, 80) in \\npatients with diabetes and 82% (95% CI: 76, 87) in control subjects. The seroprotection rates in \\nthose with diabetes aged 20 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, and at least 60 years were \\n89%, 81%, 83%, and 58%, respectively. The seroprotection rates in those without diabetes in \\nthese same age-groups were 100%, 86%, 82%, and 70%, respectively. Subjects with diabetes and \\na BMI of at least 30 kg/m2 had a seroprotection rate of 72% compared with 80% in diabetic \\nsubjects with lower BMIs. In control subjects, seroprotection rates were 82% in those with a \\nBMI of at least 30 kg/m2 and 83% in those with lower BMIs. \\n\\n14.3 Immunogenicity in Neonates  \\n\\nIn clinical studies, neonates were given ENGERIX-B (10 mcg/0.5 mL) at age 0, 1, and 6 months \\nor at age 0, 1, and 2 months. The immune response to vaccination was evaluated in sera obtained \\n1 month after the third dose of ENGERIX-B. \\n\\nAmong infants administered ENGERIX-B at age 0, 1, and 6 months, 100% of evaluable subjects \\n(n = 52) seroconverted by Month 7. The GMT was 713 mIU/mL. Of these, 97% had \\nseroprotective levels (≥10 mIU/mL). \\n\\nAmong infants enrolled (n = 381) to receive ENGERIX-B at age 0, 1, and 2 months, 96% had \\nseroprotective levels (≥10 mIU/mL) by Month 4. The GMT among seroconverters (n = 311) \\n(antibody titer ≥1 mIU/mL) was 210 mIU/mL. A subset of these children received a fourth dose \\nof ENGERIX-B at age 12 months. One month following this dose, seroconverters (n = 126) had \\na GMT of 2,941 mIU/mL. \\n\\n14.4 Immunogenicity in Children and Adults  \\n\\nPersons Aged 6 Months through 10 Years \\n\\nIn clinical trials, children (N = 242) aged 6 months through 10 years were given ENGERIX-B \\n(10 mcg/0.5 mL) at 0, 1, and 6 months. One to 2 months after the third dose, the seroprotection \\nrate was 98% and the GMT of seroconverters was 4,023 mIU/mL. \\n\\nPersons Aged 5 through 16 Years \\n\\nIn a separate clinical trial including both children and adolescents aged 5 through 16 years, \\nENGERIX-B (10 mcg/0.5 mL) was administered at 0, 1, and 6 months (n = 181) or 0, 12, and \\n\\n\\n\\n14 \\n\\n24 months (n = 161). Immediately before the third dose of vaccine, seroprotection was achieved \\nin 92.3% of subjects vaccinated on the 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule and 88.8% of subjects on the \\n0-, 12-, and 24-month schedule (GMT: 118 mIU/mL versus 162 mIU/mL, respectively, \\nP = 0.18). One month following the third dose, seroprotection was achieved in 99.5% of children \\nvaccinated on the 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule compared with 98.1% of those on the 0-, 12-, and \\n24-month schedule. GMTs were higher (P = 0.02) for children receiving vaccine on the 0-, 1-, \\nand 6-month schedule compared with those on the 0-, 12-, and 24-month schedule \\n(5,687 mIU/mL versus 3,159 mIU/mL, respectively). \\n\\nPersons Aged 11 through 19 Years \\n\\nIn clinical trials with healthy adolescent subjects aged 11 through 19 years, ENGERIX-B \\n(10 mcg/0.5 mL) given at 0, 1, and 6 months produced a seroprotection rate of 97% at Month 8 \\n(n = 119) with a GMT of 1,989 mIU/mL (n = 118, 95% CI: 1,318, 3,020). Immunization with \\nENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) at 0, 1, and 6 months produced a seroprotection rate of 99% at \\nMonth 8 (n = 122) with a GMT of 7,672 mIU/mL (n = 122, 95% CI: 5,248, 10,965). \\n\\nPersons Aged 16 through 65 Years \\n\\nClinical trials in healthy adult and adolescent subjects (aged 16 through 65 years) have shown \\nthat following a course of 3 doses of ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) given at 0, 1, and 6 months, \\nthe seroprotection (antibody titers ≥10 mIU/mL) rate for all individuals was 79% at Month 6 \\n(5 months after second dose) and 96% at Month 7 (1 month after third dose); the GMT for \\nseroconverters was 2,204 mIU/mL at Month 7 (n = 110). \\n\\nAn alternate 3-dose schedule (20 mcg/1 mL given at 0, 1, and 2 months) designed for certain \\npopulations (e.g., individuals who have or might have been recently exposed to the virus and \\ntravelers to high-risk areas) was also evaluated. At Month 3 (1 month after third dose), 99% of \\nall individuals were seroprotected and remained protected through Month 12. On the alternate \\nschedule, a fourth dose of ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) at 12 months produced a GMT of \\n9,163 mIU/mL at Month 13 (1 month after fourth dose) (n = 373). \\n\\nPersons Aged 40 Years and Older \\n\\nAmong subjects aged 40 years and older given ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) at 0, 1, and \\n6 months, the seroprotection rate 1 month after the third dose was 88% and the GMT for \\nseroconverters was 610 mIU/mL (n = 50). In adults aged older than 40 years, ENGERIX-B \\nproduced anti-HBsAg antibody titers that were lower than those in younger adults. \\n\\n14.5 Interchangeability with Other Hepatitis B Vaccines  \\n\\nA controlled study (N = 48) demonstrated that completion of a course of immunization with \\n1 dose of ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) at Month 6 following 2 doses of RECOMBIVAX HB \\n[Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)] (10 mcg) at Months 0 and 1 produced a similar GMT \\n(4,077 mIU/mL) to immunization with 3 doses of RECOMBIVAX HB (10 mcg) at Months 0, 1, \\n\\n\\n\\n15 \\n\\nand 6 (GMT: 2,654 mIU/mL). Thus, ENGERIX-B can be used to complete a vaccination course \\ninitiated with RECOMBIVAX HB.8 \\n\\n15 REFERENCES  \\n\\n1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hepatitis B.

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ENGERIX-B is indicated for immunization against infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus. 2 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intramuscular administration. See Section 2.2 for subcutaneous administration in persons at risk of hemorrhage. 2.1 Preparation for Administration Shake well before use. With thorough agitation, ENGERIX-B is a homogeneous, turbid white suspension. Do not administer if it appears otherwise. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. If either of these conditions exists, the vaccine should not be administered. For the prefilled syringes, attach a sterile needle and administer intramuscularly. For the vials, use a sterile needle and sterile syringe to withdraw the vaccine dose and administer intramuscularly. Changing needles between drawing vaccine from a vial and injecting it into a recipient is not necessary unless the needle has been damaged or contaminated. Use a separate sterile needle and syringe for each individual. 2.2 Administration ENGERIX-B should be administered by intramuscular injection. The preferred administration site is the anterolateral aspect of the thigh for infants younger than 1 year and the deltoid muscle in older children (whose deltoid is large enough for an intramuscular injection) and adults. ENGERIX-B should not be administered in the gluteal region; such injections may result in suboptimal response. ENGERIX-B may be administered subcutaneously to persons at risk of hemorrhage (e.g., hemophiliacs). However, hepatitis B vaccines administered subcutaneously are known to result in a lower antibody response. Additionally, when other aluminum-adsorbed vaccines have been administered subcutaneously, an increased incidence of local reactions including subcutaneous nodules has been observed. Therefore, subcutaneous administration should be used only in persons who are at risk of hemorrhage with intramuscular injections. Do not administer this product intravenously or intradermally. 2.3 Recommended Dose and Schedule Persons from Birth through 19 Years Primary immunization for infants (born of hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]-negative or HBsAg-positive mothers), children (birth through 10 years), and adolescents (aged 11 through 19 years) consists of a series of 3 doses (0.5 mL each) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. Persons Aged 20 Years and Older Primary immunization for persons aged 20 years and older consists of a series of 3 doses (1 mL each) given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. 3 Adults on Hemodialysis Primary immunization consists of a series of 4 doses (2-mL each) given as a single 2-mL dose or two 1-mL doses on a 0-, 1-, 2-, and 6-month schedule. In hemodialysis patients, antibody response is lower than in healthy persons and protection may persist only as long as antibody levels remain above 10 mIU/mL. Therefore, the need for booster doses should be assessed by annual antibody testing. A 2-mL booster dose (as a single 2-mL dose or two 1-mL doses) should be given when antibody levels decline below 10 mIU/mL.1 [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] Table 1. Recommended Dosage and Administration Schedules Group Dosea Schedules Infants born of: HBsAg-negative mothers 0.5 mL 0, 1, 6 months HBsAg-positive mothersb 0.5 mL 0, 1, 6 months Children: Birth through 10 years 0.5 mL 0, 1, 6 months Adolescents: Aged 11 through 19 years 0.5 mL 0, 1, 6 months Adults: Aged 20 years and older 1 mL 0, 1, 6 months Adults on hemodialysis 2 mLc 0, 1, 2, 6 months HBsAg = Hepatitis B surface antigen. a 0.5 mL (10 mcg); 1 mL (20 mcg). b Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 12 hours after birth [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. c Given as a single 2-mL dose or as two 1-mL doses. 2.4 Alternate Dosing Schedules There are alternate dosing and administration schedules which may be used for specific populations (e.g., neonates born of hepatitis B–infected mothers, persons who have or might have been recently exposed to the virus, and travelers to high-risk areas) (Table 2). For some of these alternate schedules, an additional dose at 12 months is recommended for prolonged maintenance of protective titers. 4 Table 2.

Studies have demonstrated a substantial increase in antibody titers after booster vaccination with ENGERIX-B. See Section 2.3 for information on booster vaccination for adults on hemodialysis. 2.6 Known or Presumed Exposure to Hepatitis B Virus Persons with known or presumed exposure to the hepatitis B virus (e.g., neonates born of infected mothers, persons who experienced percutaneous or permucosal exposure to the virus) should be given hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) in addition to ENGERIX-B in accordance with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations and with the package insert for HBIG. ENGERIX-B can be given on either dosing schedule (0, 1, and 6 months or 0, 1, 2, and 12 months). 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS ENGERIX-B is a sterile suspension available in the following presentations: • 0.5-mL (10 mcg) prefilled TIP-LOK syringes • 1-mL (20 mcg) single-dose vials and prefilled TIP-LOK syringes [See Description (11), How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16).] 5 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of any hepatitis B-containing vaccine, or to any component of ENGERIX-B, including yeast, is a contraindication to administration of ENGERIX-B [see Description (11)]. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Syncope Syncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, including ENGERIX-B. Syncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual disturbance, paresthesia, and tonic-clonic limb movements. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope. 5.2 Infants Weighing Less than 2,000 g at Birth Hepatitis B vaccine should be deferred for infants with a birth weight <2,000 g if the mother is documented to be HBsAg negative at the time of the infant’s birth. Vaccination can commence at chronological age 1 month or hospital discharge. Infants born weighing <2,000 g to HBsAg- positive mothers should receive vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours after birth. Infants born weighing <2,000 g to mothers of unknown HBsAg status should receive vaccine and HBIG within 12 hours after birth if the mother’s HBsAg status cannot be determined within the first 12 hours of life. The birth dose in infants born weighing <2,000 g should not be counted as the first dose in the vaccine series and it should be followed with a full 3-dose standard regimen (total of 4 doses).2 [See Dosage and Administration (2).] 5.3 Apnea in Premature Infants Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some infants born prematurely. Decisions about when to administer an intramuscular vaccine, including ENGERIX-B, to infants born prematurely should be based on consideration of the infant’s medical status, and the potential benefits and possible risks of vaccination. For ENGERIX-B, this assessment should include consideration of the mother’s hepatitis B antigen status and the high probability of maternal transmission of hepatitis B virus to infants born of mothers who are HBsAg positive if vaccination is delayed. 5.4 Preventing and Managing Allergic Vaccine Reactions Prior to immunization, the healthcare provider should review the immunization history for possible vaccine sensitivity and previous vaccination-related adverse reactions to allow an assessment of benefits and risks. Epinephrine and other appropriate agents used for the control of immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available should an acute anaphylactic reaction occur. [See Contraindications (4).] 6 5.5 Moderate or Severe Acute Illness To avoid diagnostic confusion between manifestations of an acute illness and possible vaccine adverse effects, vaccination with ENGERIX-B should be postponed in persons with moderate or severe acute febrile illness unless they are at immediate risk of hepatitis B infection (e.g., infants born of HBsAg-positive mothers). 5.6 Altered Immunocompetence Immunocompromised persons may have a diminished immune response to ENGERIX-B, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy. 5.7 Multiple Sclerosis Results from 2 clinical studies indicate that there is no association between hepatitis B vaccination and the development of multiple sclerosis,3 and that vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine does not appear to increase the short-term risk of relapse in multiple sclerosis.4 5.8 Limitations of Vaccine Effectiveness Hepatitis B has a long incubation period. ENGERIX-B may not prevent hepatitis B infection in individuals who had an unrecognized hepatitis B infection at the time of vaccine administration. Additionally, it may not prevent infection in individuals who do not achieve protective antibody titers. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most common solicited adverse reactions were injection site soreness (22%) and fatigue (14%). In 36 clinical studies, a total of 13,495 doses of ENGERIX-B were administered to 5,071 healthy adults and children who were initially seronegative for hepatitis B markers, and healthy neonates. All subjects were monitored for 4 days post-administration. Frequency of adverse reactions tended to decrease with successive doses of ENGERIX-B. Using a symptom checklist, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site soreness (22%) and fatigue (14%). Other reactions are listed below. Parent or guardian completed forms for children and neonates. Neonatal checklist did not include headache, fatigue, or dizziness. Incidence 1% to 10% of Injections Nervous System Disorders: Dizziness, headache. 7 General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Fever (>37.5°C), injection site erythema, injection site induration, injection site swelling. Incidence <1% of Injections Infections and Infestations: Upper respiratory tract illnesses. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Lymphadenopathy. Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders: Anorexia. Psychiatric Disorders: Agitation, insomnia. Nervous System Disorders: Somnolence, tingling. Vascular Disorders: Flushing, hypotension. Gastrointestinal Disorders: Abdominal pain/cramps, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Erythema, petechiae, pruritus, rash, sweating, urticaria. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: Arthralgia, back pain, myalgia, pain/stiffness in arm, shoulder, or neck. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Chills, influenza-like symptoms, injection site ecchymosis, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, irritability, malaise, weakness. In a clinical trial, 416 adults with type 2 diabetes and 258 control subjects without type 2 diabetes who were seronegative for hepatitis B markers received at least 1 dose of ENGERIX-B. Subjects were monitored for solicited adverse reactions for 4 days following each vaccination. The most frequently reported solicited adverse reactions in the entire study population were injection site pain (reported in 39% of diabetic subjects and 45% of control subjects) and fatigue (reported in 29% of diabetic subjects and 27% of control subjects). Serious adverse events were monitored through 30 days following the last vaccination. Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 3.8% of diabetic subjects and 1.6% of controls. No SAEs were deemed related to ENGERIX-B. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ENGERIX-B. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the vaccine. Infections and Infestations Herpes zoster, meningitis. 8 Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Thrombocytopenia. Immune System Disorders Allergic reaction, anaphylactoid reaction, anaphylaxis. An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome (serum sickness-like) of delayed onset has been reported days to weeks after vaccination, including: arthralgia/arthritis (usually transient), fever, and dermatologic reactions such as urticaria, erythema multiforme, ecchymoses, and erythema nodosum. Nervous System Disorders Encephalitis; encephalopathy; migraine; multiple sclerosis; neuritis; neuropathy including hypoesthesia, paresthesia, Guillain-Barré syndrome and Bell’s palsy; optic neuritis; paralysis; paresis; seizures; syncope; transverse myelitis. Eye Disorders Conjunctivitis, keratitis, visual disturbances. Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Earache, tinnitus, vertigo. Cardiac Disorders Palpitations, tachycardia. Vascular Disorders Vasculitis. Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders Apnea, bronchospasm including asthma-like symptoms. Gastrointestinal Disorders Dyspepsia. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Alopecia, angioedema, eczema, erythema multiforme including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema nodosum, lichen planus, purpura. Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthritis, muscular weakness. General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Injection site reaction. 9 Investigations Abnormal liver function tests. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Concomitant Administration with Vaccines and Immune Globulin ENGERIX-B may be administered concomitantly with immune globulin. When concomitant administration of other vaccines or immune globulin is required, they should be given with different syringes and at different injection sites. Do not mix ENGERIX-B with any other vaccine or product in the same syringe or vial. 7.2 Interference with Laboratory Tests HBsAg derived from hepatitis B vaccines has been transiently detected in blood samples following vaccination. Serum HBsAg detection may not have diagnostic value within 28 days after receipt of a hepatitis B vaccine, including ENGERIX-B. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ENGERIX-B in pregnant women in the U.S. Available data do not suggest an increased risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in women who received ENGERIX-B during pregnancy (see Data). There are no animal studies with ENGERIX-B to inform use during pregnancy. A developmental toxicity study was performed in female rats administered a vaccine with the same hepatitis B surface antigen component and quantity as ENGERIX-B prior to mating and during gestation (0.2 mL at each occasion). This study revealed no adverse effects on fetal or pre-weaning development (see Data). Data Human Data: In an evaluation of pre- and post-licensure clinical trials of ENGERIX-B, 58 pregnant women were inadvertently administered ENGERIX-B following their last menstrual period. After excluding elective terminations (n = 6), those with an unknown outcome (n = 3), those with exposure in the third trimester (n = 1), and those with an unknown exposure timing (n = 22), there were 26 pregnancies with known outcomes with exposure in the first or second trimester. Miscarriage was reported in 11.5% of pregnancies with exposure prior to 20 weeks of gestation (3/26) and major birth defects were reported in 0% (0/23) of live births born to women 10 with exposure during the first or second trimester. The rates of miscarriage and major birth defects were consistent with estimated background rates. No pregnancy registry for ENGERIX-B was conducted. TWINRIX [Hepatitis A & Hepatitis B (Recombinant) Vaccine] is a bivalent vaccine containing the same hepatitis B surface antigen component and quantity as used in ENGERIX-B. Therefore, clinical data accrued with TWINRIX are relevant to ENGERIX-B. A pregnancy exposure registry was maintained for TWINRIX from 2001 to 2015. The registry prospectively enrolled 245 women who received a dose of TWINRIX during pregnancy or within 28 days prior to conception. After excluding induced abortions (n = 6, including one of a fetus with congenital anomalies), those lost to follow-up (n = 142), those with exposure in the third trimester (n = 1), and those with an unknown exposure timing (n = 9), there were 87 pregnancies with known outcomes with exposure within 28 days prior to conception, or in the first or second trimesters. Miscarriage was reported for 9.6% of pregnancies with exposure to TWINRIX prior to 20 weeks gestation (8/83). Major birth defects were reported for 3.8% of live born infants whose mothers were exposed within 28 days prior to conception or during the first or second trimester (3/80). The rates of miscarriage and major birth defects were consistent with estimated background rates. Animal Data: In a developmental toxicity study, female rats were administered TWINRIX, which contains the same hepatitis B surface antigen component and quantity as ENGERIX-B, by intramuscular injection on Day 30 prior to mating and on gestation Days 6, 8, 11, and 15. The total dose was 0.2 mL (divided) at each occasion (a single human dose is 1 mL). No adverse effects on pre-weaning development up to post-natal Day 25 were observed. There were no fetal malformations or variations. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of ENGERIX-B in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for ENGERIX-B and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ENGERIX-B or from the underlying maternal condition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to disease prevented by the vaccine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ENGERIX-B have been established in all pediatric age-groups. Maternally transferred antibodies do not interfere with the active immune response to the vaccine. [See Adverse Reactions (6), Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.3, 14.4).] The timing of the first dose in infants weighing less than 2,000 g at birth depends on the HBsAg status of the mother. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2).] 11 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ENGERIX-B used for licensure did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, in later studies it has been shown that a diminished antibody response and seroprotective levels can be expected in persons older than 60 years.5 [See Clinical Studies (14.2).] 11 DESCRIPTION ENGERIX-B [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)] is a sterile suspension of noninfectious HBsAg for intramuscular administration. It contains purified surface antigen of the virus obtained by culturing genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, which carry the surface antigen gene of the hepatitis B virus. The HBsAg expressed in the cells is purified by several physicochemical steps and formulated as a suspension of the antigen adsorbed on aluminum hydroxide. The procedures used to manufacture ENGERIX-B result in a product that contains no more than 5% yeast protein. Each 0.5-mL pediatric/adolescent dose contains 10 mcg of HBsAg adsorbed on 0.25 mg aluminum as aluminum hydroxide. Each 1-mL adult dose contains 20 mcg of HBsAg adsorbed on 0.5 mg aluminum as aluminum hydroxide. ENGERIX-B contains the following excipients: Sodium chloride (8 mg/mL) and phosphate buffers (disodium phosphate dihydrate, 0.9 mg/mL; sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate, 0.7 mg/mL). ENGERIX-B is available in vials (adult dose only) and prefilled syringes. The tip cap and rubber plunger stopper of the prefilled syringe are not made with natural rubber latex. The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. ENGERIX-B is formulated without preservatives. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Infection with hepatitis B virus can have serious consequences including acute massive hepatic necrosis and chronic active hepatitis. Chronically infected persons are at increased risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Antibody concentrations ≥10 mIU/mL against HBsAg are recognized as conferring protection against hepatitis B virus infection.1 Seroconversion is defined as antibody titers ≥1 mIU/mL. 12 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ENGERIX-B has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential, or for impairment of male fertility in animals. Vaccination of female rats with TWINRIX, which contains the same HBsAg component and quantity as ENGERIX-B, had no effect on fertility. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.1).] 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Efficacy in Neonates Protective efficacy with ENGERIX-B has been demonstrated in a clinical trial in neonates at high risk of hepatitis B infection.6,7 Fifty-eight neonates born of mothers who were both HBsAg- positive and hepatitis B “e” antigen (HBeAg)-positive were given ENGERIX-B (10 mcg/0.5 mL) at 0, 1, and 2 months, without concomitant hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). Two infants became chronic carriers in the 12-month follow-up period after initial inoculation. Assuming an expected carrier rate of 70%, the protective efficacy rate against the chronic carrier state during the first 12 months of life was 95%. 14.2 Efficacy and Immunogenicity in Specific Populations Homosexual Men ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) given at 0, 1, and 6 months was evaluated in homosexual men aged 16 to 59 years. Four of 244 subjects became infected with hepatitis B during the period prior to completion of the 3-dose immunization schedule. No additional subjects became infected during the 18-month follow-up period after completion of the immunization course. Adults with Chronic Hepatitis C In a clinical trial of 67 adults aged 25 to 67 years with chronic hepatitis C, ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) was given at 0, 1, and 6 months. Of the subjects assessed at Month 7 (n = 31), 100% responded with seroprotective titers. The geometric mean antibody titer (GMT) was 1,260 mIU/mL (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 709, 2,237). Adults on Hemodialysis Hemodialysis patients given hepatitis B vaccines respond with lower titers, which remain at protective levels for shorter durations than in normal subjects. In a clinical trial of 56 adults who had been on hemodialysis for a mean period of 56 months, ENGERIX-B (40 mcg/2 mL given as two 1-mL doses) was given at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. Two months after the fourth dose, 67% (29/43) of patients had seroprotective antibody levels (≥10 mIU/mL) and the GMT among seroconverters was 93 mIU/mL. 13 Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus In a descriptive study, 674 adult subjects with type 2 diabetes (diagnosed within the preceding 5 years) or without type 2 diabetes were enrolled and stratified by age and body mass index (BMI). The per-protocol immunogenicity cohort included 378 diabetic subjects and 189 matched control subjects who received ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) at 0, 1, and 6 months. Among these subjects, the mean age was 54 years (range: 20 to 82 years); mean BMI was 32 kg/m2 (range: 17 to 64 kg/m2); 51% were male; 88% were white, 3% were American Indian or Alaskan Native, 3% were black, 2% were Asian, 4% were other racial groups; 2% were Hispanic or Latino. The overall seroprotection rates (1 month after the third dose) were 75% (95% CI: 71, 80) in patients with diabetes and 82% (95% CI: 76, 87) in control subjects. The seroprotection rates in those with diabetes aged 20 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, and at least 60 years were 89%, 81%, 83%, and 58%, respectively. The seroprotection rates in those without diabetes in these same age-groups were 100%, 86%, 82%, and 70%, respectively. Subjects with diabetes and a BMI of at least 30 kg/m2 had a seroprotection rate of 72% compared with 80% in diabetic subjects with lower BMIs. In control subjects, seroprotection rates were 82% in those with a BMI of at least 30 kg/m2 and 83% in those with lower BMIs. 14.3 Immunogenicity in Neonates In clinical studies, neonates were given ENGERIX-B (10 mcg/0.5 mL) at age 0, 1, and 6 months or at age 0, 1, and 2 months. The immune response to vaccination was evaluated in sera obtained 1 month after the third dose of ENGERIX-B. Among infants administered ENGERIX-B at age 0, 1, and 6 months, 100% of evaluable subjects (n = 52) seroconverted by Month 7. The GMT was 713 mIU/mL. Of these, 97% had seroprotective levels (≥10 mIU/mL). Among infants enrolled (n = 381) to receive ENGERIX-B at age 0, 1, and 2 months, 96% had seroprotective levels (≥10 mIU/mL) by Month 4. The GMT among seroconverters (n = 311) (antibody titer ≥1 mIU/mL) was 210 mIU/mL. A subset of these children received a fourth dose of ENGERIX-B at age 12 months. One month following this dose, seroconverters (n = 126) had a GMT of 2,941 mIU/mL. 14.4 Immunogenicity in Children and Adults Persons Aged 6 Months through 10 Years In clinical trials, children (N = 242) aged 6 months through 10 years were given ENGERIX-B (10 mcg/0.5 mL) at 0, 1, and 6 months. One to 2 months after the third dose, the seroprotection rate was 98% and the GMT of seroconverters was 4,023 mIU/mL. Persons Aged 5 through 16 Years In a separate clinical trial including both children and adolescents aged 5 through 16 years, ENGERIX-B (10 mcg/0.5 mL) was administered at 0, 1, and 6 months (n = 181) or 0, 12, and 14 24 months (n = 161). Immediately before the third dose of vaccine, seroprotection was achieved in 92.3% of subjects vaccinated on the 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule and 88.8% of subjects on the 0-, 12-, and 24-month schedule (GMT: 118 mIU/mL versus 162 mIU/mL, respectively, P = 0.18). One month following the third dose, seroprotection was achieved in 99.5% of children vaccinated on the 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule compared with 98.1% of those on the 0-, 12-, and 24-month schedule. GMTs were higher (P = 0.02) for children receiving vaccine on the 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule compared with those on the 0-, 12-, and 24-month schedule (5,687 mIU/mL versus 3,159 mIU/mL, respectively). Persons Aged 11 through 19 Years In clinical trials with healthy adolescent subjects aged 11 through 19 years, ENGERIX-B (10 mcg/0.5 mL) given at 0, 1, and 6 months produced a seroprotection rate of 97% at Month 8 (n = 119) with a GMT of 1,989 mIU/mL (n = 118, 95% CI: 1,318, 3,020). Immunization with ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) at 0, 1, and 6 months produced a seroprotection rate of 99% at Month 8 (n = 122) with a GMT of 7,672 mIU/mL (n = 122, 95% CI: 5,248, 10,965). Persons Aged 16 through 65 Years Clinical trials in healthy adult and adolescent subjects (aged 16 through 65 years) have shown that following a course of 3 doses of ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) given at 0, 1, and 6 months, the seroprotection (antibody titers ≥10 mIU/mL) rate for all individuals was 79% at Month 6 (5 months after second dose) and 96% at Month 7 (1 month after third dose); the GMT for seroconverters was 2,204 mIU/mL at Month 7 (n = 110). An alternate 3-dose schedule (20 mcg/1 mL given at 0, 1, and 2 months) designed for certain populations (e.g., individuals who have or might have been recently exposed to the virus and travelers to high-risk areas) was also evaluated. At Month 3 (1 month after third dose), 99% of all individuals were seroprotected and remained protected through Month 12. On the alternate schedule, a fourth dose of ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) at 12 months produced a GMT of 9,163 mIU/mL at Month 13 (1 month after fourth dose) (n = 373). Persons Aged 40 Years and Older Among subjects aged 40 years and older given ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) at 0, 1, and 6 months, the seroprotection rate 1 month after the third dose was 88% and the GMT for seroconverters was 610 mIU/mL (n = 50). In adults aged older than 40 years, ENGERIX-B produced anti-HBsAg antibody titers that were lower than those in younger adults. 14.5 Interchangeability with Other Hepatitis B Vaccines A controlled study (N = 48) demonstrated that completion of a course of immunization with 1 dose of ENGERIX-B (20 mcg/1 mL) at Month 6 following 2 doses of RECOMBIVAX HB [Hepatitis B Vaccine (Recombinant)] (10 mcg) at Months 0 and 1 produced a similar GMT (4,077 mIU/mL) to immunization with 3 doses of RECOMBIVAX HB (10 mcg) at Months 0, 1, 15 and 6 (GMT: 2,654 mIU/mL). Thus, ENGERIX-B can be used to complete a vaccination course initiated with RECOMBIVAX HB.8 15 REFERENCES 1. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hepatitis B.
